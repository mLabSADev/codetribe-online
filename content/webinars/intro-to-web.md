# CodeTribe Bootcamp 2023 

A pre-recorded session of an introduction to HTML session that was held during the CodeTribe Bootcamp 2023 on the 1st of February 2023. This session focused on several key concepts of HTML including headings, paragraphs, tables, navigation, head/main/footer and the implementation of a basic design using the same skills. Whether you were able to attend the live session or not, this video provides a comprehensive overview of these important topics for web development and on how to build a basic website structure.

We start with an overview of HTML and what it means to build a website using HTML code. From there, we dive into creating headings, paragraphs, and tables. We show you how to use headings to organise your content and create clear, easy-to-read sections. You'll learn how to use paragraphs to create blocks of text, and how to use tables to organise data.

Next, we cover navigation elements, including the head, main, and footer sections. You'll learn how to create a header that contains your logo and navigation links, how to create a main section that contains the content of your website, and how to create a footer that contains information such as contact details and copyright information.

We then demonstrate how to implement a basic design using the skills you've learned so far. We show you how to add background colours and borders, how to control the size of your content, and add basic styling to your website.

By the end of the video, you'll have a solid understanding of the basics of HTML and be well on your way to building your first website. Whether you're just starting out or you're looking to brush up on your HTML skills, this video provides a comprehensive introduction to HTML and the key elements you'll need to know.
