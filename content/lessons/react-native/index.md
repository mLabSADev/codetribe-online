The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React, except that React Native
does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process, which
interprets the JavaScript written by the developers, directly on the end-device and
communicates with the native platform via serialised data over an asynchronous and batched
bridge.

React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React's
declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript.
While React Native styling has a similar syntax to CSS, it does not use HTML or CSS. Instead,
messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. With React Native,
developers have to write native code in the languages of the aimed platform such as Java or
Kotlin for Android, Objective-C or Swift for iOS, and C++/WinRT or C# for Windows 10.
